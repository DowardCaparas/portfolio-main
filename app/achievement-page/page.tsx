          . My team and I were so happyâ€”it was the moment we had been working
          for. As the programmer of the team, I remembered all the late nights
          we spent thinking about how to build the system. Seeing our hard work
          pay off felt amazing. We couldn&apos;t have done it without God&apos;s
          help and the support of each other. <br /> <br />

            Our project was created using Unity3D and C#. It is a 2D game with
            fun features to help kids learn easily. The game teaches about
            planets, constellations, galaxies, and special materials found on
            certain planets. It includes three mini-games: Planet Adventure,
            Word Puzzle, and Sliding Puzzle.
