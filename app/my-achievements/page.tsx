          we spent thinking about how to build the system. Seeing our hard work
          pay off felt amazing. We couldn&apos;t have done it without God&apos;s

            Our project was created using Unity3D and C#. It is a 2D game with
            fun features to help kids learn easily. The game teaches about
            planets, constellations, galaxies, and special materials found on
            certain planets. It includes three mini-games: Planet Adventure,
            Word Puzzle, and Sliding Puzzle.
